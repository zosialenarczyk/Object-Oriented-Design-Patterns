TODO:

- unit tests
- fix the error with too long chars in cout
- what about destrcutors? where is it necessary to define them?
- shall i leave short, one line method implementaions in header file?
- what is overload resolution? (at some point there was an error related to this issue)
- what about std::make_unique() instead of 'new' in constructors? what's the difference?


DONE:
- rethink how to implement 'virtual defualt constructor' using virtual method create()
-> i guess it's ok
